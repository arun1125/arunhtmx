    "Bayesian is cool but just a way to model beliefs. Probability statements need CALIBRATION.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian statistics isn't new, it's been around since thomas bayes came up with it back in the 1700s. The formula is derived just with some substituting and rearranging nothing fancy but this shift in perspective gives us a whole new way of looking at things - a new philosophy.\n",
    "\n",
    "__The Frequentist__ - The OG: \n",
    "The old school (well before 1700 I guess) philosophy says that there is only one true answer and at the heart of this attitude is the belief that a true answer already exists. Buuuuuuuuuut, to measure it you must take a large number of samples and find the most _frequent_ one. Thats your true value! Why we have to take a large amount because we believe that every measurement comes with a little error.\n",

    "5000\n",
    "\n",
    "it's looking like our mountains true height value is close to 5000\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### But the Bayesian\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bayesian thinks a little different, he believes every observation has some information in it and the bayesian attitude is believing that there isn't one true value for your process but in fact a distribution. So with the mountain before, a Bayeisn would say that the true value of the height of the mountain is a meaningless idea. Instead, every measurement of the height of the mountain describes some point on the ground to some point near the top of the mountain but they wont be the identical two points every time. so even though every measurement has a different value, each one is an accurate measurement of something we could call the height of the mountain.\n"
